Bootstrap is a large framework that comes with a lot of code and scripts.  This large framework can be a system hog, dampening page performance and draining batteries.  MUI on the other hand uses React components that are independent of each other so you can use only what you want/need.  While it is possible to get into the Bootstrap code and weed out components you are not using, it is tedious and time consuming and defeats one of Bootstrap\u2019s big selling points, development speed.  Bootstrap is known for creating quickly using reusable code and components.  Customization ties into development speed and is probably where Boostrap and MUI diverge the most.  While Bootstrap components can be customized they sometimes get criticized for looking a little stock where MUI offers seemingly endless customization.  The actual code to customize MUI components can become quite involved."),l.a.createElement("p",null,"I usually like to use visuals to illustrate points.  Below are two screen caps from the same login page.  The first one is using Bootstrap and achieves a nice clean design where the second is using MUI and achieves a more slick design."),l.a.createElement("p",null,"Bootstrap:"),l.a.createElement("img",{src:"/assets/images/blog/bootstrap-login.png"}),l.a.createElement("p",null,"MUI:"),l.a.createElement("img",{src:"/assets/images/blog/mui-login.gif"})," ",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("p",null,"Who uses which?  Bootstrap:  Twitter (obviously), Airbnb, Apple Music, Dropbox, Spotify, Lyft.  MUI: Amazon, Nasa, all Google products.  Which should you choose?  Both are completely professional and valid options.  It is completely up to you and your project.  Or maybe don\u2019t choose at all, it is entirely possible to just use both at the same time.  If you are going to mix the two you might want to check out MDB - Material Design for Bootstrap which is a single React library that tries to give you the best of both worlds.  Bootstrap and MUI aren\u2019t the only players in town either.  Other industry heavies to explore are Chakra UI, Blueprint UI, and Ant Design; all with unique features and use cases."),l.a.createElement("p",null,"Before I close this out, I also wanted to mention a really cool web-app that I used to make the header image for this post.
