            Man that is cliche.  I have never written a blog.  Actually that is not entirely true, I loosely maintained a LiveJournal back in the day.  <i>(just googled it and LiveJournal launched in 1999... wow).</i>  That was a long time ago.\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                  This entire personal site is built with React.  Hence the cool React atom <code>gif</code> up top.  Side note: in case you were wondering, the front pic of this website (at the time of writing this) is a photo I took in 2019 in Joshua Tree, CA.  Back to coding stuff - despite being a developer who was mostly focused on Python, data analysis, and backend technologies, reading and hearing things about React, I decided to see what the hype was all about with this frontend library.  With just a little bit of <code>jsx</code> syntax down, React proved to be intuitive and just as exciting as the hype suggested.  The comminity that exudes the hype is also vast which is great.  The resources available to React developers at this point feel cutting edge, shoutout to Netlify (who is hosting this site) for some of the easiest and fastest deployment for React apps.\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Ok cool, first blog post (and love letter to React apparently) down.

Specifically <code>npx create-react-app</code>, which is an awesome way to start using/learning React and creating single page applications.  By the way, if you are familiar with Node (server-side JavaScript), that <code>npx</code> command is not a typo, instead of the normal <code>npm</code>, <code>npx</code> is npm's package runner tool, think of the <i>x</i> as <i>execute</i>.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    <code>npx create-react-app</code> is not the only game in town for creating React apps.  Especially if you want more than just a frontend pipeline (to be used with whatever backend you like).  Enter React's officially recommended toolchains.  There are many options with different features/use cases.  On the list is Gatsby (a contender for the subject of a near future post), Neutrino, NX, Parcel, Razzle, and Next.js.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Next.js is a React framework and React is a JavaScript library and JavaScript is a programming language, not to be confused with Java which is a compiling language whereas JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language.  Any questions?  🙃\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                I coded a blog (not this one) out using Vercel's tutorial about creating a Next.js app (all 500 tweetable points too).  It is easy to see why Next.js is so popular.  I like how fast it is because of the two forms of pre-rendering.  Next.js has both static generation and server-side rendering.  Next.js also comes with some intuitive routing.  I also like how easy it is to create a post for the blog using markdown rendering.  This page is built entirely in <code>jsx</code> while the posts on my Next.js blog are simply markdown (like your <code>README.md</code>) files.  Which is cool, I personally like markdown syntax, I find it to be like a simplified html.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                If you are relatively new to React and haven't tried Next.js yet, open up your favorite terminal and throw down <code>npx create-next-app</code> (don't forget to add a title) and hit it.  \n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Peace,\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Adam\n                                </p>\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-music-alt\"> Music: Beastie Boys - Paul's Boutique</span>\n                                {/*<br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-face-smile\"> Mood: Productive</span>*/}\n\n                                <br /><br /><br />\n                                <GoBack />\n\n\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Container>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SecondBlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { FaCheck } from \"react-icons/fa\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-grid-system\";\n// Components\nimport GoBack from \"../common/GoBack\";\n\nfunction ThirdBlogPost() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"section section-single-post section-single-post-1\">\n            <div className=\"display-spacing\">\n                <Container>\n                    <div className=\"max-w-768 div-center\">\n                        <div className=\"post\">\n                            <div className=\"post-head\">\n                                <div class=\"post-info\">\n                                    <GoBack />\n                                    <h1>Content Management Systems</h1>\n                                    <p>\n                                        by <span className=\"author\">Adam</span> {/*in*/} <span className=\"category\">{/*Business*/}</span> on <span class=\"date\">June 26, 2021</span>.\n                                    </p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"post-body\">\n                                <div className=\"post-image\">\n                                    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/cms.gif\" />\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"post-content\">\n                                    \n                                <h4>CMS 🤯</h4> \n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Like probably most software developers early in their careers, I have been thinking about doing some freelance work.

I won’t get into Wordpress here, let’s go beyond it.  To go beyond traditional WordPress/CMS, let’s get into headless CMS. \n                                </p>\n                                <p> \n\n                                WTF is headless CMS - headless CMS is a backend that makes content accessible via a RESTful API.  What does that mean and why is it cool?  If a full-stack website were anthropomorphized into a robot or android or something, headless CMS allows you to chop off the ugly old head that was designed in the late 1990’s or something and build a fancy new one with whatever modern tools you like.  In this analogy, the spinal cord would be the RESTful API that allows the new fancy head to still work with the old body.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n\n                                One of my preferred modern tools to make new heads for my robots is React.  With a headless CMS, you can make a fancy React app and connect it back to your CMS with an API.  Let’s start with Frontity.  Frontity touts themselves as THE React framework for WordPress.  For the record, you do not have to use a framework however that would require manually coding out many lists of tasks, routing, server rendering, and data retrieval from WordPress.  You can do that if you have the time and interest in it but using tech like this often reminds me about reading that Tesla uses Stripe as their payment processing platform.  Telsa, you know Elon Musk, that guy, who invented PayPal, he likes Stripe and uses it instead of his own software.  Anyway, Frontity seems like a great solution for using React with WordPress CMS.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                If you want to move away from WordPress and still use React, Strapi looks like one of the more popular and best options.  Full disclosure, I did come across a Strapi vs Sanity debate.  To not splinter too far into different rabbit holes, let’s focus on Strapi.  Strapi call themselves “the next-gen headless CMS, open-source, javascript, enabling content- rich experiences to be created, managed and exposed to any digital device.”  The sub-reddit calls it “The most advanced open-source Content Management Framework to build a powerful API with no effort.”  I copied and pasted that because I found it to be true.  Within just a few minutes using their documentation I had an API up and running, see pic directly below.  \n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/strapi.png\" />\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                Naturally, the rabbit hole does not stop with WordPress, Frontity, Strapi or even React at all, in fact WordPress is all PHP anyway.  I consider myself a Python dev and specifically find Django to be incredibly powerful.  Django comes with an admin interface out of the box but is not considered to be CMS.  There seem to a few good Python/Django CMS options, the top two being Wagtail and Django-CMS (runner up: Mezzanine).  Wagtail appears to be a little more popular, probably largely due to the fact that Django-CMS is complex and probably overkill for a lot of projects.  They can both be integrated with existing Django apps and are both loaded with features.  Using Django-CMS or Wagtail means developing fully in Python instead of using PHP which will also probably mean better security, more customizable,  higher speed over time, better scalability and personally means I get to develop in a preferred language.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Did this post go off the rails a little?  Welcome to the world of the self-taught developer.

According to… the internet (I googled it) about 65% of all websites on the internet use WordPress for CMS.  Another wild purported fact, 40% of all websites on the internet are actually WordPress sites.  For this project, WordPress was actually perfect for me as the developer and the client so I didn't fight it.\n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                I wanted to write a little about Django and specifically Django REST Framework. I personally love developing with Python and Django specifically. I am not alone here on the Python/Django bandwagon - Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, DropBox, NASA, Reddit, Udemy, Robinhood, all use Django (Most of them use React on the frontend too).   One of the most powerful features Django has is its ORM, or Object Relational Mapper. In other words, you can use Python instead of SQL to create, query and modify databases. Developing the frontend you can use the Django Template Language out of the box, which is great for slipping a variable or some logic into some HTML but is ultimately a little limiting.  A much more modern approach would be to develop the frontend independently with tools like React.  Scalability and speed are among many more advantages this method provides.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                If you are like Instagram and want to use Django as the backend of a project and connect it to a React frontend UI, one of the best ways to connect them is to have Django serve up an API.  Enter the Django REST framework.  Django REST framework is a toolkit for building APIs and has some impressive features such as Oauth1(& 2), serialization for aforementioned ORM data sources and a very cool web browsable API.  The web browsable API is an interface where you can easily view your API instances and perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.  You can view and edit the raw JSON data or the more userfriendly HTML form.  Check out the screen cap below from a recent project.\n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/rollinsquote.png\" />\n                                <p>\n                                Building these API views can be accomplished with just a few lines of Python code.  There are class based views and function based views.  Whichever method suits your project best you will have to identify some similar information such as specifying the type of HTTP method or action you want to perform.  In function based views this can be accomplished by specifying the method in the API view decorator for the function: for example  <code>@api_view([‘POST’])</code> .  The decorator defaults to GET if left blank.  Another decorator that Django REST framework provides that I think is extremely useful is <code>@permission_classes()</code>.  With this decorator you can protect certain API views by allowing only authenticated users access.  To utilize JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, a very common approach with Django REST framework would be to use the Simple JWT library.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Speaking of JSON data and developing with Python, I’d like to mention my preference for pipenv.  Pipenv describes itself as “a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world.”  It does this by handling the developer dependencies with a Pipfile, think requirements.txt, and a Pipfile.lock file which is JSON and like the name suggests, handles the virtual environment.  It’s very cool and familiar especially if you use npm or yarn on a regular basis.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                *December 2021 addendum: Regarding that entire last paragraph, I have found pipenv to be a little limiting and have gone back to using tried and true <code>virtualenv</code> and requirements.txt for dependencies.\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Peace,\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Adam\n                                </p>\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-music-alt\"> Music: Orville Peck</span>\n                                <br />\n                                {/*<span className=\"ti-face-smile\"> Mood: Productive</span>*/}\n\n                                <br /><br /><br />\n                                <GoBack />\n\n\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Container>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default FourthBlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { FaCheck } from \"react-icons/fa\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-grid-system\";\n// Components\nimport GoBack from \"../common/GoBack\";\n\nfunction FifthBlogPost() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"section section-single-post section-single-post-1\">\n            <div className=\"display-spacing\">\n                <Container>\n                    <div className=\"max-w-768 div-center\">\n                        <div className=\"post\">\n                            <div className=\"post-head\">\n                                <div class=\"post-info\">\n                                    <GoBack />\n                                    <h1>Backend GraphQL with Python</h1>\n                                    <p>\n                                        by <span className=\"author\">Adam</span> {/*in*/} <span className=\"category\">{/*Business*/}</span> on <span class=\"date\">July 23, 2021</span>.\n                                    </p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"post-body\">\n                                <div className=\"post-image\">\n                                    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/graphqlpython.png\" />\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"post-content\">\n                                    \n                                <h4></h4> <br />\n                                \n                                <p>\n                                    I was recently asked to help develop a project and one of the technologies used for the project is GraphQL.  GraphQL is something I have read lightly about but never dove in.  So I did to familiarize myself with it.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    What is GraphQL?\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p>\n                                    \"GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.\"   - <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">graphql.org</a>\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    So, GraphQL is a query language for APIs, <b>NOT</b> databases.  GraphQL claims to be the new API standard,  providing a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook and is now maintained by a large community of developers.  GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API.  Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Since GraphQL is API focused, it is usually thought of as frontend technology but the API is still implemented on the backend (server side).  GraphQL servers are available for many languages (Haskell, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, C++, C#, Scala, Go, Rust, Elixir, Erlang, PHP, R, D and Clojure).  I decided to dive in using Python 🐍 so I could experiment using Django as my framework.  Since choosing to work with Python and Django I also utilized Graphene, which is a Python library for building GraphQL schemas/types using a code-first approach.  Code-first meaning, instead of coding in GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language), you can code in Python.  Schema-first would be the contrasting approach (i.e. Apollo for JavaScript and Ariadne for Python).  Graphene also has a Django specific module.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    A really cool thing about developing a GraphQL backend API is that it allows developers to focus on describing the data available rather than implementing and optimizing specific endpoints.  It allows this through a schema and resolve functions.  In GraphQL, a Type is an object that may contain multiple fields. Each field is calculated through resolvers, that returns a value. A collection of types is called a schema.  The schema is a model of the data that can be fetched through the GraphQL server.   It defines what queries clients are allowed to make, what types of data can be fetched from the server, and what the relationships between these types are.  The schema tells the server what queries clients are allowed to make, and how different types are related but they do not handle where the data comes from.  Enter the resolve functions.  Resolve functions specify how the types and fields in the schema are connected to the backend(s).  GraphQL resolve functions can contain arbitrary code, which means a GraphQL server can to talk to any kind of backend and any kind of database.  Another really cool feature of GraphQL is that no matter how many backends you use, all the client will see is a single GraphQL endpoint with a simple, self-documenting API.\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p>\n                                    Another big feature of GraphQL is the integrated, interactive in-browser IDE, Graph<i>i</i>QL.  See directly below.\n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/graphql1.png\" />\n                                <p>\n                                    Graph<i>i</i>QL provides a a split window interface for queries on the left and results on the right.  It also provides a GraphQL documentation search feature.  It is also built with React which was not surprising to discover. Above is an example of what a query of the GraphQL server looks like and below is mutating (sending data to) the server. \n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/graphql2.png\" />\n\n                                <p>\n                                    Those initial links that were queried were originally created with Django.  Using Django has other advantages like user authentication.  Creating a schema class in Django, you can create users through Graph<i>i</i>QL.  Using the django-graphql-jwt library you can implement JWT (JSON) tokens which is the more modern method of authenticating users.\n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/graphql3.png\" />\n                                <p>\n                                    It's pretty to easy to see why these GraphQL APIs are so popular, especially when thought of in the context of frontend development.  Being able to specify exactly what you want out of an API means saving on payload size which means saving on bandwidth which also includes minimizing round trips to the server which means more saving on bandwidth (plus many, many more advantages) which equals GraphQL providing the natural evolution of the REST API. \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Maybe the next blog post should be about frontend development using GraphQL.  Maybe the next post will be about artificial intelligence and natural language processing.  I am working on a chatbot project with some friends and creating virtual assistants is fascinating and allows for some very cool technologies in the area of machine learning.  Stay tuned (😂).\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Peace,\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Adam\n                                </p>\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-music-alt\"> Music: Wu Tang Clan - Enter the 36 Chambers</span>\n                                <br />\n                                {/*<span className=\"ti-face-smile\"> Mood: Productive</span>*/}\n\n                                <br /><br /><br />\n                                <GoBack />\n\n\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Container>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default FifthBlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { FaCheck } from \"react-icons/fa\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-grid-system\";\n// Components\nimport GoBack from \"../common/GoBack\";\n\nfunction SixthBlogPost() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"section section-single-post section-single-post-1\">\n            <div className=\"display-spacing\">\n                <Container>\n                    <div className=\"max-w-768 div-center\">\n                        <div className=\"post\">\n                            <div className=\"post-head\">\n                                <div class=\"post-info\">\n                                    <GoBack />\n                                    <h1>Redux</h1>\n                                    <p>\n                                        by <span className=\"author\">Adam</span> {/*in*/} <span className=\"category\">{/*Business*/}</span> on <span class=\"date\">Sept 1, 2021</span>.\n                                    </p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"post-body\">\n                                <div className=\"post-image\">\n                                    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/redux.jpg\" />\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"post-content\">\n                                    \n                                <h4>Redux</h4> <br />\n                                \n                                <p>\n                                Redux seems to be slippery for a lot of newer developers to get a firm grasp on.  At a quick glance some definitions and examples can seem both very vague and very complicated at the same time.  Redux comes with an entire new vocabulary that can be a little intimidating as well - we’ve got a store, actions, dispatchers, reducers, thunks… all for managing application state.  Even the term ‘state’ might be a little foreign to developers who primarily develop with backend technologies.  Let’s simply break down some of these terms and lift the veil of obscurity on Redux.\n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Let’s clear up that <b>state</b> issue before anything else.  I found an eloquent quote from Stack Overflow: “An application's state is roughly the entire contents of its memory.”  Application state is data that is stored in memory on the server or locally.  Using application state is useful because it is faster than storing and retrieving information from a database. \n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Ok now that everybody is clear on what state is - Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and updating application state.  Redux is not a React specific library but I will be talking about it in the context of React.  Redux is not really for state between components but for global or app wide state and works best with applications that have a large amount of global state that is accessed by many of the application’s components. A main goal of using Redux is scalability for managing these large amount of global state.\n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Even though Redux is not React specific it does have an official Redux UI binding library for React, aptly called React Redux.  On top of Redux and React Redux, there is a third dependency that should be installed if utilizing Redux in a React application, Redux Thunk.  Redux Thunk allows for asynchronous requests from the store, which brings us to our first new Redux specific vocabulary word.\n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                <b>The store</b> - the heart of Redux is the store.  The store (there should be only one per Redux application) is an object that holds the application’s state tree.  The store holds the state.  The reason that is important is because the store has the ability to update the global state of an application which would affect elements of the application’s UI.  The global state in the store should never be accessed directly, that is done through functions provided by the store.  While researching this I came across an analogy that I will paraphrase.  The store can be thought of like the vault in a brick and mortar bank. In order to access contents of the vault, you must fill out a withdrawal form and speak to a teller, maybe a manager if you want large amounts of content.  The point being, you can’t just walk right up to the vault.  Before we get into those functions to access the vault, now would probably be a good time to mention the one way data flow of Redux.\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/ReduxDataFlowDiagram.gif\" />\n                                <br /> <br />\n                                <p>\n                                Straight from the official Redux docs.  It’s not stealing if my CodeCademy Pro 10 hour Redux certification course can use the identical gif (very humble flex 😎).  So the data flows from state to view to action back to state and so on.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                <b>Actions</b> - the only way to get data into the store.  An action is just a JavaScript object that represents an intention to change the store’s state.  It is an event that describes something that happened in the application.  An action has only one required field (even though it can have many more and the structure is customizable) and that is type.  The type field should be a string that gives the action a descriptive name.  The standard naming convention is \"domain/eventName\", where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened.  An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called payload.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                The way state gets changed is through Reducer functions.  <b>Reducers</b> are functions (that accept actions) that are responsible for passing state to components.  You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action ( or event) type.  So, a reducer takes in current state and an action and returns the new state based on the action it receives.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                <b>Dispatchers</b> are Redux store functions that trigger events in an application.  They let the store know about something that happened.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Finally we have the weirdest Redux vocabulary word - <b>Thunk</b>.  As in the past tense for think, something like “I already thunk about it”.  A thunk (not exclusive to Redux btw) is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into another subroutine.  Or a function that is used to delay a computation until it is needed by the application.  By default, JavaScript functions are thunks since they hold information and can be executed any time or passed to another function (to also be executed at any time).  So, in Redux thunks can be used to hold asynchronous logic that interacts with the Redux store.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Without going too deep into the rabbit hole, that is essentially Redux at its core.  Developing with Redux gives you access to some cool dev tools for monitoring, debugging and testing application state changes. \n                                </p>\n                                \n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/wrcartstate.png\" />\n\n                                <p>\n                                Above screen cap is the Redux devtools from an e-commerce project I have been working on.  For this project I am using Redux to manage the global state of users data, products, orders and as shown above, shopping cart items.  In this case I am utilizing the local storage for the state.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Without getting into specific code, I think that is a pretty comprehensive conceptual introduction to Redux.\n                                </p>\n\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Peace,\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Adam\n                                </p>\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-music-alt\"> Music: Ghostface Killah - Supreme Clientele</span>\n                                <br />\n                                {/*<span className=\"ti-face-smile\"> Mood: Productive</span>*/}\n\n                                <br /><br /><br />\n                                <GoBack />\n\n\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Container>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SixthBlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { FaCheck } from \"react-icons/fa\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-grid-system\";\n// Components\nimport GoBack from \"../common/GoBack\";\n\nfunction SeventhBlogPost() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"section section-single-post section-single-post-1\">\n            <div className=\"display-spacing\">\n                <Container>\n                    <div className=\"max-w-768 div-center\">\n                        <div className=\"post\">\n                            <div className=\"post-head\">\n                                <div class=\"post-info\">\n                                    <GoBack />\n                                    <h1>PostgreSQL</h1>\n                                    <p>\n                                        by <span className=\"author\">Adam</span> {/*in*/} <span className=\"category\">{/*Business*/}</span> on <span class=\"date\">Nov 9, 2021</span>.\n                                    </p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"post-body\">\n                                <div className=\"post-image\">\n                                    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/pythonpostgres.png\" />\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"post-content\">\n                                    \n                                <h4>Databases</h4> <br />\n                                \n                                <p>\n                                    Since Django is my preferred backend framework, PostgreSQL has followed as my preferred database.  Even though Django connects to a SQLite database out of the box, PostgreSQL (or just Postgres) is one of four other officially supported databases.  The others being MySQL (owned by Microsoft), MariaDB (which is a fork of MySQL), and Oracle.  Since Oracle is notoriously expensive to run, Postgres is probably the most powerful and versatile database officially supported by Django.  Well, technically PostgreSQL is an object relational database management system (RDBMS).  The word database is used a little ubiquitously; a database can really refer to any collection of data, not even necessarily on a computer and a data base management system is software that allows you to interact with a database.\n\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Let’s circle back to Django’s stock database, SQLite.  SQLite is a file based, serverless database.  As the name suggests, it is super lightweight.  Being lightweight comes with advantages and disadvantages.  Advantages include ease of use, especially with Django.  There is a small footprint, no configuration, no external dependencies and is actually a great solution for applications that read and write files to disk directly.  A few disadvantages include scalability, security, user management and concurrency.  This is where Postgres can step in.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    A little background - Postgres has been around for 30 years and is open source which means there is a tremendous community of developers supporting it and keeping it modern.  It is also flexible and scalable enough for it to be used for free in testing and small app development and to be used in production as the primary database for new startups and tech giants like Apple, Instagram and Reddit.  It is also fully ACID (database integrity standards) and SQL compliant, where technically MySQL is not. \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    While MySQL remains the more popular and more widely used RDBMS, Postgres does outshine in a few more ways.  MySQL can be more costly to run and does reserve some features and plugins for proprietary licenses.  Postgres supports additional data types too.  Postgres and MySQL both support string, numeric, date and time data types but Postgres extends support for JSON, network addresses, geometric shapes, text searches, currency and more.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Developing with Postgres also means options as far as clients go.  You can use the command line to query the database using a tool like <code>psql</code> or you can go the graphic user interface (GUI) route and use cross-platform software like Postbird or the more robust and popular PgAdmin (see stock photo below).  In addition to those tools Postgres even features a native Mac OS app. \n                                </p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/pgadmin.png\" />\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <p>\n                                    In order to use Postgres with Django you will have to <code>pip install psycopg</code>.  “Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language” says their website.  That could be because the official Django documentation states that Psycopg 2.5.4 or higher is required.  Once the adapter is installed to the project, connecting a Django backend to a live Postgres server is just a matter of editing a few lines in the <code>settings.py</code> file.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    I hope that comparing and contrasting PostgreSQL to SQLite and MySQL helped to shine some light on these popular databases. \n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p>\n                                    Peace,\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Adam\n                                </p>\n                                <br /><br />\n                                <span className=\"ti-music-alt\"> Music: Black Sabbath - Master of Reality</span>\n                                <br />\n                                <br /><br /><br />\n                                <GoBack />\n\n\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </Container>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SeventhBlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { FaCheck } from \"react-icons/fa\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-grid-system\";\n// Components\nimport GoBack from \"../common/GoBack\";\n\nfunction EighthBlogPost() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"section section-single-post section-single-post-1\">\n            <div className=\"display-spacing\">\n                <Container>\n                    <div className=\"max-w-768 div-center\">\n                        <div className=\"post\">\n                            <div className=\"post-head\">\n                                <div class=\"post-info\">\n                                    <GoBack />\n                                    <h1>Bootstrap vs Material-UI</h1>\n                                    <p>\n                                        by <span className=\"author\">Adam</span> {/*in*/} <span className=\"category\">{/*Business*/}</span> on <span class=\"date\">Jan 9, 2022</span>.\n                                    </p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"post-body\">\n                                <div className=\"post-image\">\n                                    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/muiandbootstrap.jpg\" />\n                                </div>\n                                <div className=\"post-content\">\n                                    \n                                <h4>Frontend Design</h4> <br />\n                                \n                                <p>\n                                Since the previous post was about backend tech, PostgreSQL (databases) & Python, I figured the next one can be about frontend.  I want to explore and compare two super popular frontend design tools, Material-UI and Bootstrap or React-Bootstrap to be more specific.  These two tools are for building what most people associate frontend design with, the actual user interface (UI) with the user experience (UX) in mind.  These two tools both help people create user interfaces by providing pre-built elements.  Or a little more plainly, you don’t have to code <i>everything</i> by hand. \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Bootstrap describes itself as the world’s most popular frontend open source toolkit.  It is an HTML, CSS, JS framework with pre-built elements.  Originally called Twitter Blueprint, Bootstrap was initially created by Twitter to help them build faster with more consistency.  In 2011 Twitter open sourced it, changed its name and released it to the public.  Keeping with the rise in popularity of React, Bootstrap was rebuilt for React as React-Bootstrap.  The components were rebuilt from scratch as true React components cutting out unneeded dependencies such as jQuery.  In the last couple years jQuery has been hotly debated and is largely thought to be in pre-obsolescence.  Note:  you can still use Bootstrap without React, I will just be focusing on React-Bootstrap. \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Material-UI (or just MUI) is a React UI library that adheres to Material Design principles.  Material Design, originally called Quantum Paper, is a design language developed by Google in 2014.  Material Design was developed to deliver consistent, intuitive, cross-platform design.  The Material Design principles try to bring natural or real world laws to user interface design.  Natural or real world laws meaning it takes principles for motion, interaction, animation, navigation, typography, shapes, shadows, colors, etc all into account.  So, MUI is a React component library with an entire elaborate design theory behind it.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                A few years ago mobile devices accounted for about half of all internet traffic.  Unsurprisingly, that number has continued to grow to around 70%.  With about 3.5 billion smartphones in circulation (there’s less than 8 billion humans on Earth right now), it is estimated that people are spending up to an average of 5 hours a day using their smartphones.  It is not unreasonable to assume the recent pandemic has helped boost these statistics but for some people, smartphones are how they access the web.  I’m not just talking about third world/developing countries but giant swaths of demographics all over.  Over 95% of active Facebook traffic comes from mobile devices now.  Do your parents even have a desktop anymore or just tablets?  Are you reading this on your phone right now?  With these massive numbers come the general dismissal of sites and apps that are not mobile friendly.  If somebody has a negative mobile experience, the chances of them recommending or returning to the site or app drops significantly.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                It makes sense that both Bootstrap and MUI both take a mobile-first  or responsive-design approach.  Responsive web design is making sure your site or app renders well on a variety of window and screen sizes.  How does Bootstrap and MUI achieve this?  With responsive grid systems.  They both use a similar 12-grid system that helps elements on a page automatically rearrange and resize.  Bootstrap uses rows, columns and containers and MUI uses columns, gutters and margins.  Both Bootstrap and MUI also have excellent browser compatibility.  Since different browsers render code differently, browser compatibility should always be taken into consideration.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Some key differences between Boostrap and MUI are their dependencies, development speed and customization.  Bootstrap is a large framework that comes with a lot of code and scripts.  This large framework can be a system hog, dampening page performance and draining batteries.  MUI on the other hand uses React components that are independent of each other so you can use only what you want/need.  While it is possible to get into the Bootstrap code and weed out components you are not using, it is tedious and time consuming and defeats one of Bootstrap’s big selling points, development speed.  Bootstrap is known for creating quickly using reusable code and components.  Customization ties into development speed and is probably where Boostrap and MUI diverge the most.  While Bootstrap components can be customized they sometimes get criticized for looking a little stock where MUI offers seemingly endless customization.  The actual code to customize MUI components can become quite involved.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                I usually like to use visuals to illustrate points.  Below are two screen caps from the same login page.  The first one is using Bootstrap and achieves a nice clean design where the second is using MUI and achieves a more slick design.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>Bootstrap:</p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/bootstrap-login.png\" />\n                                <p>MUI:</p>\n                                <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/mui-login.gif\" /> <br /><br />\n                                <p>\n                                Who uses which?  Bootstrap:  Twitter (obviously), Airbnb, Apple Music, Dropbox, Spotify, Lyft.  MUI: Amazon, Nasa, all Google products.  Which should you choose?  Both are completely professional and valid options.  It is completely up to you and your project.  Or maybe don’t choose at all, it is entirely possible to just use both at the same time.  If you are going to mix the two you might want to check out MDB - Material Design for Bootstrap which is a single React library that tries to give you the best of both worlds.  Bootstrap and MUI aren’t the only players in town either.  Other industry heavies to explore are Chakra UI, Blueprint UI, and Ant Design; all with unique features and use cases.  \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                Before I close this out, I also wanted to mention a really cool web-app that I used to make the header image for this post.  <a style={{color: 'blue'}} href=\"https://www.photopea.com\">Photopea</a> is essentially a free in-browser Photoshop with all kinds of templates ready to go.
